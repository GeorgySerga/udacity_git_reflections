# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Well, as I see it git creates .git directory, where metadata about files, their states (hashes maybe) is stored. Why - because we want to track changes in our files, track out commits and so on.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can add files that i want to be commited (may be some trash in working directory, drafts etc.). Also I can make logical commits, chosing what to commit first.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

As was written before, chose needed files, commit, repeat.

# What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Two different versions of app might be under the development, and while you can change bugs on the stable version you also might develop new features, separately.
